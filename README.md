# Barebone
 A barebone minecraft: bedrock edition server software

Barebone is not a "Plug and play" Serversoftware. On its own, its useless.

All it does on its own is joining and spawning. Everything else has to be implemented by a developer.

This is alot of work, but in return, you'll get a serversoftware that just does what you need.
